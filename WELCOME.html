             You’ve taught me lessons I could never have learned on my own. You kept me from hardships 
             and errors in my own ways. I Love You!You are the kindest, most generous human being on the 
             planet. You set the primary example of what being a compassionate individual is like. You have
              solid emotions when I am weak. I only hope to embody the physical and emotional strength you 
              have.Thank you, Dad, for always smiling when you opened your presents from me and never telling
               me you have enough shirts. Even though I know you have enough shirts.You are an amazing man.
                The world is a better place because you’re in it. I love you Dad.Anytime I needed someone to 
                talk to or a shoulder to cry on, you were there. You are my rock.<p style="color: rgb(56, 20,
